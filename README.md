## What is LaTeX?
LaTeX, pronounced lay-tech, is a document preparation system commonly used by scientists, engineers, mathematicians and other professionals. Unlike a typical “what you see is what you get” word processor such a Microsoft Word, LaTeX uses a plain text markup language which is compiled into a PDF document using optimal typographical rules. This results in professional-looking documents that are of a different class to the output from a word processor. The numerous customisation options in LaTeX allow for the creation of a diversity of documents with precise control over layout and formatting. LaTeX lends itself well to the creation of templates which do not require advanced knowledge of LaTeX to use and manipulate, allowing a novice LaTeX user to create beautiful documents and learn LaTeX as they go.

## History of LaTeX
TeX was created in the late 1970’s by [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/) as a typesetting program for text and mathematical formulae. It was designed after Knuth observed that the digital typesetting software at the time was not up to the typographical standard of previous typesetting techniques and set out to design such a system. LaTeX was developed in the early 1980’s by Leslie Lamport as a higher level language that uses TeX but makes it easier to use through introducing predefined document styles, sectioning, indexing, automatic cross references, automatic numbering and a variety of other useful features. This makes LaTeX a more user-friendly experience than TeX while maintaining the power of the TeX backend.

The current version of LaTeX is 2e which was first released in 1994. This may make LaTeX seem antiquated but its power lies in the numerous packages that have since been written. These packages make LaTeX itself highly expandable by providing extended functionality to the document for almost any requirement you may have.

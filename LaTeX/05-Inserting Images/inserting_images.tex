	LaTeX, pronounced lay-tech, is a document preparation system commonly used 
	by scientists, engineers, mathematicians and other professionals. Unlike a 
	typical “what you see is what you get” word processor such a Microsoft 
	Word, LaTeX uses a plain text markup language which is compiled into a PDF 
	document using optimal typographical rules. This results in 
	professional-looking documents that are of a different class to the output 
	from a word processor. The numerous customisation options in LaTeX allow 
	for the creation of a diversity of documents with precise control over 
	layout and formatting. LaTeX lends itself well to the creation of templates 
	which do not require advanced knowledge of LaTeX to use and manipulate, 
	allowing a novice LaTeX user to create beautiful documents and learn LaTeX 
	as they go.
